👍🏻 Due to the significant attention my post received on Reddit, I wanted to celebrate this by creating a GitHub page. I am grateful for your interest, but I am new to CSS, and with your help, I aim to create a flawless experience

🙌🏻My English is a bit poor, I may make spelling mistakes in some places, sorry for that.
