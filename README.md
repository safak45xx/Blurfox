👍🏻 Due to the significant attention my post received on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/1au0bw0/blurfox/), I wanted to celebrate this by creating a GitHub page. I am grateful for your interest, but I am new to CSS, and with your help, I aim to create a flawless experience

🙌🏻My English is a bit poor, I may make spelling mistakes in some places, sorry for that.

⌚️Installation

1-Open about:config page.

2- A dialog will warn you, but ignore it, just do it press the I accept the risk! button.

3- Search for these:
  toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets
  
  layers.acceleration.force-enabled
  
  gfx.webrender.all 
  
  gfx.webrender.enabled (Boolean- true)
  
  layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled

Then make sure to enable them all!

4-Go to your Firefox profile.
macOS - Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/XXXXXXX.default-XXXXXXX.

5-Create a folder and name it chrome, then assuming that you already have cloned this repo, just copy the theme to chrome folder.

6-Restart Firefox.

🌄To change the wallpaper, place the wallpaper inside the chrome folder and rename it as "123.jpg". If you don't want to use a wallpaper, you can remove the first line of code in the usercontent.css file.

📄I set the font as the Apple system font, but it can cause issues on some websites. If you don't want to use a fixed font, you can delete the "font-family" line from the second row in the usercontent.css file.

🕷️Please report the bugs you encounter with images or videos if possible. I will do my best to solve them, and if you know any solutions, please let me know.
