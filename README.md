👍🏻 Due to the significant attention my post received on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/1au0bw0/blurfox/), I wanted to celebrate this by creating a GitHub page. I am grateful for your interest, but I am new to CSS, and with your help, I aim to create a flawless experience

🙌🏻My English is a bit poor, I may make spelling mistakes in some places, sorry for that.

🔍I have some small ideas about my [future](https://github.com/safak45xx/Blurfox-MacOS-/issues/2) plans. If you have any feedback or suggestions to add, please let me know.

🔴If you'd like to help me [resolve](https://github.com/safak45xx/Blurfox-MacOS-/issues/4) some of the issues I'm experiencing, please feel free to stop by and lend a hand.

⛔️I'm new to GitHub usage, I've tried to keep the homepage as simple and understandable as possible. Please let me know if you have any suggestions


------------------
⌚️Installation

1-Open about:config page.

2- A dialog will warn you, but ignore it, just do it press the I accept the risk! button.

3- Search for these:

  toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets
  
  layers.acceleration.force-enabled
  
  gfx.webrender.all 
  
  gfx.webrender.enabled (Boolean + button .. true)
  
  layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled

Then make sure to enable them all!

4-Go to your Firefox profile.
macOS - Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/XXXXXXX.default-XXXXXXX.

5-Create a folder and name it chrome, then assuming that you already have cloned this repo, just copy the theme to chrome folder.

6-Restart Firefox.

------------------

🥸If you want to disable wallpaper or reset the logo to default, you can check the first lines of code in the 'newtabs.css' file in the 'newtabs' folder.

🌄You placed two wallpapers named 123-dark.png and 123-light.png in the 'newtabs' folder to create a dynamic wallpaper.

🕷️Please report the bugs you encounter with images or videos if possible. I will do my best to solve them, and if you know any solutions, please let me know.

Thank You akkva
