👍🏻 Due to the significant attention my post received on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/1au0bw0/blurfox/), I wanted to celebrate this by creating a GitHub page. I am grateful for your interest, but I am new to CSS, and with your help, I aim to create a flawless experience

🙌🏻My English is a bit poor, I may make spelling mistakes in some places, sorry for that.

🔍I have some small ideas about my [future](https://github.com/safak45xx/Blurfox-MacOS-/issues/2) plans. If you have any feedback or suggestions to add, please let me know.

🔴If you'd like to help me [resolve](https://github.com/safak45xx/Blurfox-MacOS-/issues/4) some of the issues I'm experiencing, please feel free to stop by and lend a hand.

⛔️I'm new to GitHub usage, I've tried to keep the homepage as simple and understandable as possible. Please let me know if you have any suggestions

The new feature - why limit it to just the browser blur? I've applied the blur effect to popular sites with the same design style.

⛔️It's entirely up to you whether you want to use it. If you don't want to use it, you can delete the 'web' folder from the Chrome directory.


------------------
⌚️Installation

1-Open about:config page.

2- A dialog will warn you, but ignore it, just do it press the I accept the risk! button.

3- Search for these:

  toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets
  
  layers.acceleration.force-enabled
  
  gfx.webrender.all 
  
  gfx.webrender.enabled (Boolean + button .. true)

------------------

🌄To change the wallpaper, place the wallpaper inside the  newtabs folder and rename it as "123.jpg". If you don't want to use a wallpaper, you can remove the first line of code in the newtabs.css file.

📄I set the font as the Apple system font, but it can cause issues on some websites. If you don't want to use a fixed font, you can delete the "font-family" line from the second row in the newtabs folder open newtabs.css file.

🕷️Please report the bugs you encounter with images or videos if possible. I will do my best to solve them, and if you know any solutions, please let me know.

Thank You akkva
